# FrontEndTestAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.7.

## Notes

I built the popup using event delegation with an eventListener instead of using Angulars built in methods such as (click). I did this because i was unsure which you would prefer to see.

The task wasn't fully completed. The navigation and pagination for the swiper slider still needs to be completed. I would have achieved this by wrapping them in a container and giving them an absolute posiiton to the right and bottom. Then i would have adjusted the size of the chevrons.

Some minor style tweeks, extra padding, and adjust font sizes.

Swiper slider wouldn't let me style the slide from within banner-image.component.less
